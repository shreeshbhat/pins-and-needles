An intro level climbing game using dominoes

Pins & Needles is a climbing/shedding game for 2 to 4 players using 2 to 4 sets of double six dominoes. Your goal is to shed out all your tiles.

The unique twist to this game is that you can climb up or down the ranks depending on the combination lead to the play. Each player gets a double blank tile, which is a wild tile, to offer flexibility.

When you shed out, for each opponent with 5 or more tiles in their hands, you score bonus points. Therefore, you must skillfully shed out all your tiles while also denying others from getting bonus points.

This game is inspired by Sean Rossâ€™s domino games (Clackerjack, Daiquiri, and Fiddich). Pins & Needles is a gentler introduction to those games by being easier to setup, quicker to parse through the hand, and without the complexities of partnership play.
